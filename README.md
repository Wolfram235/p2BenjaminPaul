## Objective

Following the learnings in class about human computer interaction we try and understand and design a car dashboard interface, and perform case studies on various car dashboards
in the market. The purpose of this assignment is to imporove our ability to understand the different perspectives of designers and the various experiences that can be given to the user, and how various designs are interpreted by the daily user.

## Gather 5 example car dashboards

### Pros and Cons of Current Designs

1. According to the paper [Usability of Car Dashboard Displays for Elder Drivers]() published in May 2011, Elderly drivers and young drivers gave primary importance to the speedometer and the fuel gauge. The tachometer was chosen as the least important instrument. Both the groups choose the odometer (used to show the distance that the vehicle has travelled) and the tachometer as the most difficult to find quickly. 

2. Engine temperature gauge is mostly used for long distance travel. This feature is useful to keep track of the engine temperature, when the engine is running for long distances at high speeds, Keeping the temperature in check allows the driver to make a decision to stop the car and let it cool down

3. Some cars which have a display on the dashboard show errors that occupy the entire screen and do not fade away. This is a problem as the user will have to reset the display. This reset clears the warning sign completely. 

4. On the ford dashboard we can see that there are a few buttons on the dashboard itself, if these buttons are required while the driver is driving the car it may cause inconvinies to the driver as it would require short drivers to lean forward towards the dashboard to press the buttons.

5. Most of the buttons don’t have names on them if a new person is driving the car it would cause an inconvenience for them. As the some of the symbols are not standard, and some symbols are used in more than one use-case scenario.



## Common features of a car Dashboard

1.  Gauges:
Most common gauges include:   
- fuel gauge 
- temperature gauge. 

Generally located right in front of the driver. 
These are considered essential and are required to drive the vehicle safely

2. Warning Lights:
These are used to identify potential problems with the vehicle. Some of the warning lights are for simple problems while some are more serious. They could be indicating various issues such as oil change, Tire pressure, engine problems, battery, coolant, fuel, breaks, seat belt, door and air bags. Additionally, it could also be used to illuminate active functions such as turning on turn signals or hazard lights, A/C, Parking brake. Climate control, media controls.
Warning lights can be put in three categories based on their color:

i. Red: A red warning light is usually a sign of an immediate problem that needs your attention right away. In some cases, it might not be safe to keep driving if you see a red warning light.

ii. Yellow/Orange: Yellow and orange lights are usually advisories. They aren’t as urgent as red lights, but they still provide important information. For example, in most cars, the tire pressure sign, the low fuel sign, and the engine check sign are all yellow or orange. You can probably still drive the car safely for the time being, but something will require your attention soon.

iii. Green/Blue: Green and blue warning lights are typically the least urgent signs. In most cases, they just appear for your information, and they don’t indicate that you need to do any work on your car. Most green and blue lights simply tell you that a feature is activated. For example, they may tell you that your high beams are on or that your car is in ECO mode.  

3. Meters:
There are various meters provided on a car dashboard. These include: -
- Speedometer: Tells us the speed of the vehicle in KM/H (Kilometers per hour) or MP/H(Miles per Hour) 
- Tachometer: Tells us the rotation speed of the engine in RPM (Rotations per minute)
- Odometer: Tells us information the miles covered by the vehicle. There could also be a provision provided to see the trip distance as well. 

## Vehicle controls

1. Steering Wheel Controls: These include the buttons that are generally found on the steering wheel and the stalks that are behind the steering wheel
   -  Windscreen wipers: These are toggled by turning the stalks behind the steering wheel. The frequency is selected based on how far you turn the knob on the stalk.
   -  Turn Lights/ Indicators: These are toggled by pushing the stalks up and down, mostly up for left and down for right. You could think about the direction in which you want to turn the steering wheel in order to make the turn.
   -  Headlights/dip/fog lights: These are toggled the same way as the windscreen wipers. in some models it is clubbed with the windscreen wipers. This will get confusing, which is why it is suggested to put it on the other stalk.
   -  Horn: The Horn is located conveniently located at the center of the steering wheel in most of the models 
   - Cruise Controls: The cruise controls are located near the thumbs of the steering wheels, so that it is easy for the driver, to toggle and set the cruise control.
   - Media Controls: Some models have the media controls at the back of the steering wheel which is accessible by the fingers, these controls generally include the volume rockers, track skip, media change etc. 
2. Floor Controls:
-	Accelerator pedal
-	Brake pedal
-	Clutch pedal (for manual cars)
-	Gear lever
-	Handbrake or park brake

3. Console controls:
  -	Ignition (take special care with push button ignitions)
-	Hazard warning lights
-	Heating controls
-	Air conditioning controls (some newer vehicles’ air con is controlled via a touch screen)
-	Rear demister
-	Airbag deactivator
-	Your car might also have controls for hill descent mode, turning any auto stop/start features on/off, different modes for driving (e.g., sports mode or snow mode), seat heaters/coolers, and other buttons to turn on or off various features in the car.

4. Other Controls:
-	Adjust the seat and headrests (take care with electric seats or those with seat memories)
-	Adjust wing mirrors and rear-view mirror – make sure they are adjusted for maximum visibility
-	Identify blind spots
- Inspect seat belts for wear
-	Adjust the seat belt for height and tension if required (where the seat belt comes out of the B pillar there’s often the ability to slide it up and down to adjust the height to suit your comfort)
